# LifeLens: Life Expectancy Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Predicting **Life Expectancy** based on health, economic, and social factors using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes various indicators like **GDP**, **Immunization Coverage**, **Education Levels**, and **Health Expenditure**.
- Source: World Health Organization (WHO)

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that helps in understanding the key factors affecting life expectancy and provides insights for public health policies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Project Pipeline
1. **Data Collection**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering** (Encoding & Scaling)
4. **Model Selection & Training**
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
6. **Model Evaluation**
7. **Feature Importance Visualization**
8. **Model Saving**
